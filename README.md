Hi Everyone!

This web application is build with JavaScript (Vanilla JavaScript: No Framework).

Let's talk about the application , my weather app will show the weather information that it will get from the API , an Icon that shows the weather status, the temperature value (34Â°C) in Celsius unit, the weather description (clear sky), and then the user's city and country (Kartarpkur, IN).

When the user clicks on the temperature value, that will convert it from Celsius to Fahrenheit.

The API provider is http://www.OpenWeatherMap.org
